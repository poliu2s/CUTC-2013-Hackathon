This is a personalize Twitter trend visualizer web application that I built for the Canadian Undergraduate Technology Conference 2013 Hackathon.

It allows you to choose the hashtags you are interested in and plot them in colorful graphs using Data-Driven-Documents. Recommendations for similar trending hashtags is also provided. 

NOTE: The data displayed here has only static information from a run. The web app is fully capable of drawing from the Twitter stream using a Java server-side jar file.
